    title: "How to make the Internet accessible for everyone"
    abstract: "Did you know that millions of people globally experience color blindness or disabilities? In the U.S. alone, that's over 26% of adults! Is your website ready for this huge audience? 
<br><br>
Accessibility isn't just about compliance – it's about reaching everyone. The European Accessibility Act is coming into effect next year, and similar laws exist worldwide. What's more - building accessible solutions serves everyone - making your webpage easier to navigate and use and increasing customer retention.
<br><br>
During my presentation I want to introduce basics about web accessibility, show tips on how to better understand users with specific needs and talk about the most popular mistakes (and fixes for them). I will also show how to introduce accessibility into your software development lifecycle to avoid accessibility problems in the future. 
<br><br>
Let's make the Internet accessible for everyone!"
