    title: "The (Abundant) State of the Web"
    abstract: "The web platform is evolving faster than ever—and where we once waited years for broad feature support, we're now seeing capabilities land across browsers at an unprecedented pace.

In this talk, we'll explore where the web stands today, what's become reliable, and how modern features are making it easier, faster, and more capable to build for the web.

From exciting new features to evolving web capabilities, this web keynote offers a clear snapshot of the modern web—and where it's headed next."
