    title: "Chrome DevTools LIVE LIVE LIVE"
    abstract: "This isn't your average DevTools talk. This is a full-throttle, 45 minute live demo that takes you on a journey through the evolution of debugging. 

We'll start with the must-know features every developer needs, uncover some useful but rarely-known tools, and then shift to the bleeding edge: the new AI integration. You'll see firsthand how Gemini AI can analyze web performance, make sense of complex code, and help you fix bugs faster. 

No slides, just a dynamic, real-time look at how DevTools has changedâ€”and where it's going."
