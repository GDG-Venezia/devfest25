    title: "Compose Animations from A to Z"
    abstract: "To provide the best experience to your users, animations are one of the key tools. Not only they can make your UI cleaner and more polished, but they can also make it easier for users to understand what the app is doing, hinting them to the right direction.

In this talk, we will look together at the different possibilities offered by the Jetpack Compose Animation APIs."
