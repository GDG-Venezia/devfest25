    title: "Dive into advanced TypeScript"
    abstract: "Typescript or not Typescript? More than ten years have passed since its birth, and many of us still struggle to understand and love it.<br>
Well, itâ€™s time to understand more and stop bypassing it with a simple any.
Types, functions, literals, unions, intersections and so on: together, we will see all the notions that will lead you to start loving and using it to the fullest to ensure a more typologically secure future and perhaps not be hated by your future self."
