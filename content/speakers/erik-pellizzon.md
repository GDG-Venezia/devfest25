    title: "The rise of green threads"
    abstract: "In recent years, more and more programming languages are introducing green threads internally, that is, a concurrency that is built by abstracting native OS threads using the language's runtime.
<br><br>
They may have various names, but the concept is always almost the same: coroutines, virtual threads (Java 1.19+), goroutines (Go), fibers (PHP), etc.
<br><br>
But... Why? As we will see, they are great for I/O bound tasks, and we will analyze the logic behind Go's implementation, which is one of the most mature."
