    title: "Zod: Type Safety Beyond TypeScript"
    abstract: "We'll explore the fundamentals of type checking — how TypeScript handles it, and where its limitations lie.<br><br>We'll then introduce Zod, a powerful library that brings runtime validation to your TypeScript types, helping you catch issues that static typing alone can't cover.<br><br>By the end of the session, you'll be ready to integrate Zod into your codebase and ensure that changes in backend responses no longer catch you off guard."
