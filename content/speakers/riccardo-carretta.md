    title: "Web Development Simplified: Next.js and the Modern Stack"
    abstract: "The world of web development is constantly evolving, with new frameworks, libraries, and techniques emerging at a rapid pace: it's so easy to feel overwhelmed!

In this session, we'll cut through the noise and focus on one of the most popular frameworks today: Next.js.
Discover how Next.js can simplify the process of building modern websites, with a comparison of the latest rendering and data fetching methods: static (hard-coded, SSG), dynamic (client-side fetching, SSR) and hybrid (ISR, PPR).

Whether you're a beginner or have some experience, join us to gain clarity on how to build better websites, faster."
