    title: "Kotlin Multiplatform in Production: Scaling for Real Apps"
    abstract: "Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) promises a powerful way to share code across Android, iOS, and beyondâ€”but what happens when your project grows? In this talk, we'll explore what it takes to successfully scale a KMP codebase in real-world production environments.

You'll learn how to structure large multiplatform projects, manage dependencies effectively, and design a clean architecture that balances shared logic with platform-specific needs. We'll dive into tooling, testing strategies, debugging techniques, and CI/CD considerations that are essential when working with cross-platform teams.

Based on hard-earned lessons from real apps, this talk will help you avoid common pitfalls, streamline your workflow, and unlock the full potential of Kotlin Multiplatform in your next big project.

Whether you're just getting started or already deep in multiplatform development, you'll walk away with actionable insights to take your shared codebase to the next level."
