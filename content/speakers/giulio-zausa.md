    title: "Lessons learned after 5 years of web performance optimisation"
    abstract: "At Flux we are building an electronics CAD tool that runs on the browser. Turning this idea into reality turned out to be more complicated than expected, and required us to explore many different solution to use the web platform to its full potential and efficiency. After 5 years of building the product we've learnt a lot about how to build and scale complex applications on the browser, and I would like to share some of those learnings with you. In this talk I will talk about the techniques and tools we developed to manage parallelism in JavaScript, debug in depth memory usage and achieve efficient 3D rendering in the browser."
