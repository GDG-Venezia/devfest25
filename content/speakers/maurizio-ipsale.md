    title: "Oltre le Parole - Gli LLM Comprendono Davvero?"
    abstract: "Questo talk esplora la 'comprensione' degli LLM. Partendo da Cartesio e Turing, useremo la Stanza Cinese di Searle per chiederci se gli LLM (anche multimodali) comprendano o simulino. Confronteremo poi con il Funzionalismo di Putnam e l'emergenza di Hofstadter, stimolando una riflessione filosofica sulla vera natura dell'intelligenza artificiale"
