    title: "Accessibility is the new Law: A Guide to Accessible Multi-platform Development with Flutter"
    abstract: "The European Accessibility Act (EAA) has established new, mandatory standards for digital products in the EU market. Compliance with these requirements is no longer just a competitive advantageâ€”it's a baseline condition for doing business and developing high-quality software.
This talk offers a comprehensive approach to implementing accessibility in multi-platform projects. Using a real-world Flutter application as a case study, we will cover the entire development lifecycle: from establishing accessibility principles in the design phase to solving complex technical challenges on mobile, web, and TV platforms. Special attention will be given to building effective collaboration between designers and developers, which is the key to success.
Attendees will leave with practical knowledge and actionable patterns to integrate accessibility into their own development workflows."
