    title: "A Year of Compose Multiplatform Preview Tooling Improvements - We're Almost There*!"
    abstract: "Not so long ago, working with Compose Multiplatform previews could feel… character-building. Previewing composables from common code often meant jumping through awkward hoops. On top of that, the tooling was lacking in features that Jetpack Compose tooling already had in place for a while.<br><br>Over the past year, that's changed drastically. We've got a new KMP plugin, CMP preview support in common code, Hot Reload, and a lot more refreshing updates.<br><br>Join me on this journey to review the advancements made regarding Compose Multiplatform previews in 2025 so far and to have a glimpse at what's yet to come!"
