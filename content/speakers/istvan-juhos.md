    title: "Practical Tips and Tricks to Improve Your Compose Previews"
    abstract: "Jetpack Compose Preview is a powerful tool that provides real-time feedback on how our composables are rendered and even on how they behave and animate in certain conditions. While writing useful previews seems like a straightforward task, there are some things that we need to keep in mind. Preview code won't reach users of your app (hopefully!); however, it's more likely that the author of the preview and future peers as well might have to work with them eventually.
<br><br>
This talk will touch on the following topics:
- Recap on the main features and limitations of Compose previews
- How we can overcome the limitations of @Preview being an annotation
- How we can make our previews developer-friendly
- What we can use our previews for besides checking how our composables are rendered and how they behave"
