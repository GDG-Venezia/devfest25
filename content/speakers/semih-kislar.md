    title: "Being Developer at AI Era"
    abstract: "AI is no longer just something we see in sci-fi movies — it's right at the center of our daily lives and the software world. In this session, we'll talk about how being a developer is changing with the rise of AI. What skills do we need? How can beginners keep up with all these changes? And how can we use AI as a helpful teammate while coding? Together, we'll explore how to stay up-to-date, shape your career, and see AI not as a threat, but as a powerful tool to boost your potential."
