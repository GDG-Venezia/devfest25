    title: "Intro to protobuf"
    abstract: "We often rely on JSON and REST APIs for building mobile apps that communicate with backends, but they’re not the only solution. In this talk, I’ll introduce you to Protocol Buffers (protobuf), a powerful alternative that offers a language-neutral and platform-neutral way to define data structures and interfaces through an Interface Definition Language (IDL).
<br><br>
Originally developed by Google and widely adopted by companies across the industry, protobuf provides higher performance and smaller payload sizes, making it ideal for high-efficiency services. Join me to explore how protobuf works, why it's an excellent fit for modern applications, and how it powers many of the services we use every day."
