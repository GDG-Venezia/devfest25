    title: "Designing AI-Ready Architectures: Beyond the Prompt"
    abstract: "This talk will show you how to build a strong architectural foundation to work with Agentic AIs like Junie, Copilot or Claude, whether you're building a mobile app or a backend service. We'll go beyond just writing prompts and focus on creating a structure that AI can easily understand and work with.

Using examples from Kotlin projects, we'll demonstrate how architectural patterns like Model-View-Intent (MVI) can be adapted to create predictable systems for AI to interact with. You'll learn how a clear architecture makes your code easy for AI to \"read\" and understand, allowing you to scale your AI-powered applications effectively. The techniques discussed are applicable to a variety of languages and frameworks."
