    title: "XP with AI?"
    abstract: "One of the big promises of the \"AI Revolution\" is to make our lives easier as engineers. But can it really deliver on this?<br><br>On the other hand, we have techniques mainly in the realm of eXtreme Programming that emphasize collaborative work. These practices are well established and actually proven to increase both productivity and stability in software development.<br><br>So can we combine both approaches? How fruitful is it for TDD practitioners? Does it make you faster or slow you down? Can we even talk code into existence? Is it a good pairing? Can you expand your bounded context? How good is it at reviewing your code? What about documentation?<br><br>Let's take a look together! Let's see if AI assistants like Claude and Cursor can boost development workflows, how Test-Driven Development practices contribute to this, and what we can learn from actively using these AI powered tools."
