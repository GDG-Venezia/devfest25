    title: "AI Meets UI: Integrating LLMs and ML Models in Flutter Apps"
    abstract: "AI is changing the way people use apps, and as developers, it's up to us to connect smart technology with seamless user experiences. In this session, we'll look at how you can bring the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine learning into your Flutter apps in practical, approachable ways.

You'll see how to work with cloud-based models like OpenAI, Gemini, or Azure OpenAI through APIs, and how to run ML models on-device using TensorFlow Lite. From building chatbots to adding intelligent features that feel like copilots, we'll show you how to create smart, responsive apps — without compromising on performance or design.

We'll walk through architecture choices, prompt design tips, caching techniques, and security best practices, all backed by real-world examples and live demos. By the end, you'll be ready to take your Flutter apps to the next level — combining beautiful UI with intelligent AI."
