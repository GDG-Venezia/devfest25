bio: "With over a decade in the Android world, I've lived the fast-paced startup life in California before returning to France. Today, I'm leading and managing the Android team at Aircall, where we're building the best phone system for modern businesses.

Beyond Android, I'm passionate about backend development with Kotlin and exploring the possibilities of AR/VR. In 2021, I was honored to become an Android GDEâ€”continuing my mission to share knowledge and grow alongside the amazing Android community.

Outside of work, you'll find me traveling the globe or on the hunt for the perfect IPA."

    title: "You, me and Firebase Studio ðŸ”¥"
    abstract: "Imagine prototyping an app in minutes, not days! Firebase Studio, powered by AI, makes this a reality ðŸš€

After a short introduction, we'll jump on the studio to live code together a full-stack application (frontend & backend) to showcase the capabilities of the tool and have a working demo by the end of this talk.

How quickly we can prototype an app idea? What's the limitations? Is vibe-coding enough to build an app with Firebase Studio? We'll find out after this live session."
