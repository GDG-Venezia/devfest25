bio: "I am a software engineer and currently working as a senior Flutter developer in a Dutch company (remote). I have been developing Flutter for about 4.5 years. I am a Google Developer Expert for Flutter&Dart.
<br><br>
I like to share what I've learned so we can gain more perspectives. To bring this to life, I have a YouTube channel (Hello World) and a Medium account full of the Flutter contents where I share what I have learned.
<br><br>
It is entertaining to produce contents, participate in the events and organizing the events in my free time so I am an organizer in Flutter Turkey and Flutter Ankara. I love connecting with other people and learning together new technologies. Therefore I am a Flutterista in Flutteristas Community and a Women TechMakers Ambassador in Google."
