    title: "Mastering Observability with Open Source Tools"
    abstract: "Observability is no longer a nice to have, it's a foundational part of building reliable systems. In this talk, we'll explore how to master observability using powerful open source tools from the Grafana ecosystem. From metrics and logs to traces and dashboards, we'll walk through how Grafana, Loki, Tempo, and Mimir can help you gain full visibility into your applications and infrastructure. You'll learn practical strategies for setting up an observability stack, integrating it into your workflow, and scaling it in production environments. Whether you're new to observability or looking to deepen your knowledge, this session will provide concrete guidance and real-world examples to help you take control of your systems' health and performance."
