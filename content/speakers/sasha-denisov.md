    title: "On-Device fine-tuned Gemma in your Flutter app"
    abstract: "In this informative talk, I'll explain what Gemma is, for which purposes you can use it and how to integrate it, into mobile apps using Flutter. I am the creator of the flutter_gemma plugin, which utilizes the Mediapipe library to enable AI functionalities directly on devices, eliminating the need for an internet connection.

I'll cover how to fine-tune Gemma for specific business or technical needs and demonstrate this through practical examples. Additionally, I will introduce the Mediapipe framework, explaining what it is and exploring its other potential uses in mobile development."
